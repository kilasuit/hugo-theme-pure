This post demonstrates the use of the **time** parameter.

<!--more-->

When you set the `time` parameter in the front matter, the post will display a clock icon (⏰) along with the time.

## Front Matter

```toml
time = "14:30"
```

This is useful when you want to show just the time without a date, or in addition to a date field.
